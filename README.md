js-vector-matrix
================

Some basic classes for vector and matrix multiplication.

`test.html` tests `vector-matrix.js`. If it doesn't find an error, it simply prints `Done.`.

`grid.html` draws a grid and rotates it using calculations performed by `vector-matrix.js`.

and matrix classes to animate a keyboard.
